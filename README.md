# Installation
- Run the ``` run setup.sh ``` file to setup everything.
- If gpu is not required then set the gpu option in ``` config.yml ``` as False.
- If gpu is required then first set the gpu option in ``` config.yml ``` as True and then also run the ``` gpu_setup.sh ``` file.
 

# Running ns3 code
Check that all the above installation steps are completed before running main.py.

Everything can be executed form the ``` main.py ``` the only requirement is to give it the ns3 home path through command line input and every configurational thing is managed though ``` config.yml ```.
